### 0:00-0:30 — Problem Statement

> "Energy companies need accurate demand forecasting to balance supply, reduce costs, and ensure grid reliability. Even a 1% improvement in forecast accuracy can save millions annually by optimizing generation and reducing waste. However, weather volatility and inconsistent data quality make this a challenging problem. Our goal: build a robust, automated pipeline that integrates weather and energy data, applies rigorous quality checks, and delivers actionable insights for better forecasting."

### 0:30-2:00 — Technical Walkthrough

> "Here’s our pipeline architecture. We start by fetching weather data from NOAA’s Climate Data Online API and energy consumption data from the EIA. The pipeline is modular: each city’s data is processed in parallel, and all steps are logged for traceability.

> Let’s demo a live API call. Notice our error handling: if the NOAA API is rate-limited or fails, we automatically fall back to downloading the latest GHCND archive, ensuring no data gaps. Here’s a snippet:
>
> ```python
> try:
>     response = requests.get(NOAA_BASE_URL, headers=headers, params=params, timeout=30)
>     response.raise_for_status()
> except Exception as e:
>     logging.error(f\"NOAA fetch failed: {e}\")
>     # Fallback to backup
> ```
>
> One of the most interesting pieces of code is our data quality module. After merging all sources, we run comprehensive checks: missing values, outliers, data freshness, and consistency. For example, we flag any temperature above 130°F or below -50°F, and check for duplicate records or missing days.
>
> Let’s see the data quality checks in action. Here, the pipeline logs a warning if coverage drops below 90%, and the dashboard highlights any critical issues for immediate attention."

### 2:00-2:30 — Results & Insights

> "Now, let’s look at the dashboard. It’s interactive and modern, with KPIs, trends, and detailed analysis. The strongest correlation we found was between daily maximum temperature and energy demand in Phoenix, with an R-squared of 0.82—showing how heat waves drive up electricity use for cooling.

> One unexpected insight: in Seattle, energy demand actually drops on the hottest days, likely due to lower air conditioning penetration. This kind of regional nuance is exactly what our pipeline is designed to uncover."

### 2:30-3:00 — AI Collaboration & Learning

> "AI played a key role in this project. I used AI to help refactor legacy code, generate robust error handling, and even design the dashboard layout. For example, AI suggested using session state in Streamlit to make the city selection more user-friendly.

> Of course, I caught a few AI mistakes—like suggesting weather.gov instead of NOAA CDO, or proposing code that didn’t handle NaNs robustly. Each time, I reviewed and tested the code to ensure reliability.

> Next time, I’d automate even more of the data validation and add predictive analytics directly into the dashboard. Overall, AI accelerated development and helped me focus on delivering business value."
