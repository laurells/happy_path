## Most Effective Prompts

### 1. Pipeline Architecture Design
**Prompt:**  
"Design a Python data pipeline with these requirements:  
- Fetches weather data from NOAA API using station IDs  
- Pulls energy data from EIA API using region codes  
- Handles API failures with exponential backoff retries  
- Stores data in CSV with timestamped filenames  
- Includes historical backfill capability  
- Logs errors to a daily error file  
Provide the module structure and config file format."

### 2. Streamlit Visualization
**Prompt:**  
"Create a Streamlit dashboard with these 4 visualizations:  
1. Interactive folium map showing 5 US cities with current temp/energy popups  
2. Dual-axis time series chart with weekend highlighting  
3. City-colored scatter plot with regression line and R²  
4. Temperature/day-of-week heatmap with value annotations  
Include sidebar filters for date range and city selection. Use Plotly for charts."


### 3. Data Validation
**Prompt:**  
"Generate Python functions to:  
- Detect temperature outliers (< -50°F or > 130°F)  
- Identify negative energy consumption values  
- Check data freshness (<24h old)  
- Count missing values per column  
Return results as a Pandas DataFrame suitable for a QA dashboard."
