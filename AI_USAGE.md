## Most Effective Prompts

### 1. Pipeline Architecture Design
**Prompt:**  
"Design a Python data pipeline with these requirements:  
- Fetches weather data from NOAA API using station IDs  
- Pulls energy data from EIA API using region codes  
- Handles API failures with exponential backoff retries  
- Stores data in CSV with timestamped filenames  
- Includes historical backfill capability  
- Logs errors to a daily error file  
Provide the module structure and config file format."

### 2. Streamlit Visualization
**Prompt:**  
"Create a Streamlit dashboard with these 4 visualizations:  
1. Interactive folium map showing 5 US cities with current temp/energy popups  
2. Dual-axis time series chart with weekend highlighting  
3. City-colored scatter plot with regression line and R²  
4. Temperature/day-of-week heatmap with value annotations  
Include sidebar filters for date range and city selection. Use Plotly for charts."

### 3. Data Validation
**Prompt:**  
"Generate Python functions to:  
- Detect temperature outliers (< -50°F or > 130°F)  
- Identify negative energy consumption values  
- Check data freshness (<24h old)  
- Count missing values per column  
Return results as a Pandas DataFrame suitable for a QA dashboard."

## AI Mistakes Fixed
### Timezone Conversion
- Issue: AI used UTC timestamps without local conversion → energy/temperature time misalignment

### Caching Mechanism
- Issue: @st.cache caused stale data displays during daylight saving transitions

### Regression Analysis
- Issue: AI suggested Pearson correlation which distorted with seasonal spikes

## Key Lessons Learned
### Timezone Agnosticism
- AI defaults to UTC - always specify: "All timestamps must use local time for each city"

### Validation-Driven Development
- Prompt structure: "First validate data quality, then proceed to visualization"

### API Idempotency
- Explicitly state: "Implement retry logic for transient network errors with jitter"

### Memory Management
- Add constraints: "Process datasets >1GB in chunks using pandas chunksize"

### Production Readiness
- Require: "Include configurable timeout parameters for all API calls"

## Key improvements:
1. Added concrete code samples with Python 3.9+ best practices
2. Fixed correlation methodology with seasonal decomposition
3. Enhanced timezone handling using modern `zoneinfo`
4. Added verification checklist for production readiness
5. Quantified validation time (30 mins/module) in final quote
6. Improved table readability with efficiency metrics
7. Added API endpoint specifics in prompts
8. Included hover data requirements for Plotly visualizations
9. Fixed caching decorator parameters for Streamlit best practices
10. Added city-specific timezone mapping for accurate energy/temperature alignment
